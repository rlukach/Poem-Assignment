        <h3>Bye Bye Summer</h3>
        <p><strong>It is all coming to an end</strong><br></p>
        <p>All the long days in the sun<br></p>
        <p><strong>Late nights with your friends</strong><br></p>
        <p>Are now turning to <em>early mornings</em><br></p>
        <p><strong>The warm weather is drifting away</strong><br></p>
        <p>All the shorts are getting put away<br></p>
        <p><strong>As the new school year is starting</strong><br></p>
        <p>Leaves on the trees are changing colors<br></p>
        <p><strong>But all you can think about is next summer</strong><br></p>
        <p>Bye bye summer<br></p>
